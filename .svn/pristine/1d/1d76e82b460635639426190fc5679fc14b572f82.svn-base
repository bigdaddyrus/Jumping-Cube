with the ‘===’ markers at the left margin and other lines indented four spaces. Here, ‘1-’ indicates a neutral square (necessarily with one spot), ‘Nr’ indicates a red square with N spots, and ‘Nb’ indicates a blue square with N spots. Don’t use the two ‘===’ markers anywhere else in your output. This gives the autograder a way to determine the state of your game board at any point. It does not change any of the state of the program.
seed N If your program’s automated players use pseudo-random numbers to choose moves, this command sets the random seed to N (a long integer). This command has no effect if there is no random component to your automated players (or if you don’t use them in a particular game). It doesn’t matter exactly how you use N as long as your automated player behaves identically each time it is seeded with N. In the absence of a seed command, do what you want to seed your generator.
